- install wt forms

```
pip install flask-wtf
```

(wt forms)

- create forms.py (split up into managable sections of code)

```
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
```

- Registration Form class inherits from FlaskForm

```
class RegistrationForm(FlaskForm):
```

- argument is the label for the field.

```
from wtforms import StringField
username = StringField('Username')
```

- validators built into wtforms

```
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired, Length, Email
validators=[DataRequired(), etc...]
```

- Make login and sign up forms.

- For secret key, use python interpreter. You'll want to make this an environment variable at some point, which he will explain later.

```
$ python
>>> import secrets
>>> secrets.token_hex(16)
>>> exit()
```

```
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = '88a9cc22c629b6f0bf085097c0fbffb5' # (or whatever was generated by secrets)
```

- The forms are classes, then they are passed into templates in a route.

- when form has attribute action="" it's gonna post to same route we're currently on

- {{ form.hidden_tag() }} adds CSRF token (cross site refresh forgery)

- {{ form.username.label(class="form-control-label") }} - pass classes into jinja (?)

- pass form fields into template:

```
<div class="form-group">
{{ form.username.label(class="form-control-label") }} {{
form.username(class="form-control form-control-lg") }}
</div>
```
